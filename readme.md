# Card Collector
App created for easier management your own Cards Collection for Yugioh! Trading Card Games. 
(In future plans I want to create android app and support other card games (for example Magic: the Gathering) as well) 
Due to the considerable interest of the group target, I decided to hide code in github for this project 
and create this info for interested people. 
(primarily for recruiters and people, who are cheering me on this project)
